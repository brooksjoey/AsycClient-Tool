# AsycClient-Tool
A one-click tool to deploy AsyncClient.exe as a stealthy RAT. Encrypts with AES, embeds in a polymorphic loader, obfuscates with PyArmor, and wraps in a PDF-mimicking `.lnk`. Auto-deploys to HTTPS, sets persistence, and self-destructs. Requires Python 3.8+, PyInstaller, and server config. Perfect for phishingâ€”silent, evasive, and automated.
